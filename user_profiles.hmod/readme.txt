=== User Profile Module by CompCom ===

Very experimental module to create separate user profiles for the snes mini. The use of different profiles will allow each user to keep their saves/settings separate.

Setup guide:
Step 1: Use notepad++ to add user ids (ascii only) to /etc/profiles/bin/profile_list
Step 2: Add a png file with the same name as the user id to the /etc/profiles/bin/images folder.
Step 3: Edit the config.ini to make changes the to UI layout.
Step 4: When you have finished making changes install this hmod to the snes mini.
Step 5: ???
Step 6: Profit

Note: The id for the default save location is "clover". If you remove the "clover" id you will not be able to access your existing saves.
