=== User Profile Module by CompCom ===

Very experimental module to create separate user profiles for the snes mini. The use of different profiles will allow each user to keep their saves/settings separate.

Setup guide:
Step 1: Use notepad++ (or any other good text editor NOT notepad) to add user ids (ascii only) to /etc/profiles/profile_list.
Step 2: Add a 400x400 pixel png file with the same name as the user id to the /etc/profiles/ folder.
Step 3: When you have added all users install this hmod to the snes mini.
Step 4: ???
Step 5: Profit

Note: Default id for nand is "clover". If you remove "clover" id you will not be able to access your existing nand saves.
